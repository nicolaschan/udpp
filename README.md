# UDPP

> One more than UDP

An _experimental_ protocol adding the following on top of UDP:
[x] Sessions
[ ] Congestion detection
[ ] Guaranteed order
[ ] Handle larger packet sizes
[ ] Authentication and encryption

Intended use case is general real-time data transfer where guaranteed delivery is not necessary.
